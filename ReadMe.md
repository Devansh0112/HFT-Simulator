# High-Frequency Trading (HFT) Simulator Project

## Project Overview
The High-Frequency Trading (HFT) Simulator is a comprehensive software tool designed to mimic the behavior and strategies of high-frequency trading systems in capital markets. This project aims to provide an in-depth understanding of HFT algorithms, market microstructure, and the impact of latency on trading performance.

## Key Features
- **Market Data Simulation**: Generate realistic market data feeds to simulate various market conditions and price movements.
- **Order Matching Engine**: Implement a robust order matching engine to process and match buy/sell orders based on predefined rules.
- **Algorithmic Trading Strategies**: Develop and test various HFT strategies such as market making, arbitrage, and trend following.
- **Latency Analysis**: Measure and analyze the impact of network latency and execution speed on trading performance.
- **Performance Metrics**: Track key performance indicators such as profit and loss (P&L), execution time, and order fill rates.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Languages**: C++ for high-performance computing and real-time processing.
- **Libraries**: Boost for enhanced C++ functionalities, such as data structures and multithreading.
- **Data Handling**: Integration with market data sources and storage solutions to manage large datasets.
- **Testing and Benchmarking**: Unit tests and performance benchmarks to ensure the accuracy and efficiency of the simulator.

## Project Goals
- **Educational Tool**: Serve as an educational resource for students and professionals interested in HFT and quantitative finance.
- **Strategy Development**: Provide a platform for developing and backtesting custom trading strategies in a simulated environment.
- **Performance Optimization**: Explore optimization techniques to improve the speed and reliability of HFT systems.
